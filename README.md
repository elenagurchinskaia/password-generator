# Password Generator

## Description

For this project I needed to create a password generator based on certain criteria.
It can be used for by the user who has access to sencetive data, so the generator can
create a strong password that provied greater security.
The password can be be between 8 and 128 characters long. The user also asked if they
want to include lower case, upper case, numeric and/or special characters.

## Use

- Go to the website.
- Click on "Generate Password" button.
- Select needed length of the characters.
- Select or opt out of the special characters provided.
- Password is generated.
- Enjoy!
